# Sand Drop Clicker
Based on the project name, you can already get an idea of what it’ll be about, but I’ll thoroughly explain it to ensure no detail is missed. Sand Drop Clicker will be about dropping sand into a container, and the amount of sand dropped will depend on the number of clicks the user makes. Grains of sand cannot be exchanged for currency until the container for the sand is full. The game will provide the user with upgrades in exchange for currency, which will be in dollars ($). These upgrades will range from the types of consumers of sand to personal upgrades, like the container sizes. Another interesting aspect of the program is that there will be an end goal, which is uncommon in many clicking games. The end goal will involve reaching 1 billion dollars, becoming the world’s greatest sand sales man. The end goal won’t reset your progress, so you’ll be able to gain even more wealth.
